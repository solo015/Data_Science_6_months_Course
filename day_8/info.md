Data science courses
```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('datafile.csv')
```
**Viewing Data:** Use commands like head(), tail(), info() and describe() to get an overview of your dataset.

**Indexing & Selecting Data:** Get to grips with .loc[], .iloc[], and conditional selection.

# 2. Data Cleaning 🧹
**Handling Missing Data:** Utilize methods like dropna(), fillna(), and understand the importance of inplace parameter.

**Data Type Conversion:** Grasp astype() to convert data types and understand pandas’ native data types.

**Removing Duplicates:** Employ drop_duplicates() to maintain data integrity.

# 3. Data Manipulation & Analysis 📈
**Aggregation:** Use powerful grouping and aggregation tools like groupby(), pivot_table(), and crosstab().

**String Operations:** Dive into the .str accessor for essential string operations within Series.

**Merging, Joining, and Concatenating:** Understand the differences and applications of merge(), join(), and concat().

**Reshaping Data:** Grasp melt() and pivot() for transforming datasets.

# 4. Advanced Features 🎩
