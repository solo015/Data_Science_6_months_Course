# This program is for the Understanding of Operators

# Here are some operators

# integer operators
x = 16

y = 5

# float operators
z = 5.5

#String
a = "Codanics "
b = "Pakistan"


# displaying as it is the value of 'a' variable
print( a )

# two strings values will be written as it is "a" value and "b" value
print(a+b)


# Arithmetic Operators

print( x + y ) # addition
print(x-y) # Subtraction
print(x - z) # subtraction 
print(x / y) # Division
print(x * y) # multiplication
print(x % y) # Remainder

print(x - z * 4 / y + 3) # DMAS # PEMDAS #BODMAS


x = 11
y = 3
z = 5.2
# Comparison operator

print( x > y ) # x greater than y
print( x < y ) # x less than y
print( x == y) # x equal to y
print( x <= y) # x less than or equals to y
print( x >= y) # x greater than or equal to y
print(x != y ) # x does not equal to y


# how to combine two or more comparison operators in one line of code
print(x > z | y < x)
