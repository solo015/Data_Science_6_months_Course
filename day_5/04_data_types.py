# This program is for the Understanding of Data types

# Integer (int)
x = 5 

# Float
y = 5.0

# String
z = "greetings All the way from Pakistan"

# List of Integers
a = [1, 2, 3]

# List of string
a_1 = ["Saif", "Ahmed", "Tushar", "Umair"]

# Tuple of Integers
b = (1, 2, 3)

# Dictionary { key: value}
c = { "Saif": 5, "Ahmed": 5.5, "Tushar": 5.8, "Umair": 6.1}

# set
d = {1,2,3}

# Now, I have to print these types of data variables
