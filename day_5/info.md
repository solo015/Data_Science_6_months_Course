# Day-5

### In this day, I learned the some basics of Python.

1. I printed a simple `Hello world`.
   ```Python
   print("Hello World!")
   ```
2. I learned formation of variable
    ```python
    a = 34
    print(a)
    ```
3. I learned operators.
   - Arithmetic
   ```Python
   # integer operators
    x = 16
    y = 5

    # float operators
    z = 5.5

   # Arithmetic Operators

    print( x + y ) # addition
    print(x-y) # Subtraction
    print(x - z) # subtraction 
    print(x / y) # Division
    print(x * y) # multiplication
    print(x % y) # Remainder
   ```
   - Comparison Operators
    ```Python
    x = 11
    y = 3
    z = 5.2
    # Comparison operator
    print( x > y ) # x greater than y
    print( x < y ) # x less than y
    print( x == y) # x equal to y
    print( x <= y) # x less than or equals to y
    print( x >= y) # x greater than or equal to y
    print(x != y ) # x does not equal to y
    ```
4. and Also I learned data types
   ```Python
   # This program is for the Understanding of Data types

    # Integer (int)
    x = 5 

    # Float
    y = 5.0

    # String
    z = "greetings All the way from Pakistan"

    # List of Integers
    a = [1, 2, 3]

    # List of string
    a_1 = ["Saif", "Ahmed", "Tushar", "Umair"]

    # Tuple of Integers
    b = (1, 2, 3)

    # Dictionary { key: value}
    c = { "Saif": 5, "Ahmed": 5.5, "Tushar": 5.8, "Umair": 6.1}

    # set
    d = {1,2,3}

    # Now, I have to print these types of data variables

    print("Integer is : ", x)
    print("Float is : ", y)
    print("String is : ",z)
    print("List of Integers is : ",a)
    print("List of strings is : ",a_1)
    print("Tuple of Integers is : ",b)
    print("Dictionary of Integers is : ",c)
    print("set of Integers is : ",d)
    ```
